## Definition
    - A website is a text file with text and 'markup' code that can be 'rendered' in a webbrowser to be displayed as a proper website.

## Properties and Functions
    - There are two views of a webpage: the 'source code' view and the 'rendered' view.
    - The source view of any website can be viewed from the browser and is made up of HTML tags of which
    some are optional and some not.
    - e.g of HTML tags:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title></title>
        </head>
        <body>
        % here is all the content that will appear on the webpage%
            <h1> % header % </h1>
            <p> % paragraph % </p>
            <a href = 'otherpage.html'></a> % creates a hyperlink %
        </body>
    </html>

    all these tags are mandatory
    - websites are saved with the extension .html
