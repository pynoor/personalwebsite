# Project: Personal Website

In this repo I will attempt to create my personal website from scratch. I have never created a website before and have little to no experience with HTML, CSS, etc., so this should be fun :p

I will be using extensive resources (aka the internet) along the line to help me out with the different steps.
Wait - which steps?

Right, no idea. I am currently watching a series on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJhhLvW-Xvg) about someone who has designed and coded their own websites in 12 hours to help me out a bit.

Clearly I won't finish this in 12 hours but we need to start somewhere :)

My current plan is to follow his plan (excellent plan - I know) and learn continuously what I need to learn to be able to follow the steps.

Disclaimer : My plan might change along the line. A lot of times.

Lettttt's get it.
